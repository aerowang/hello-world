# hello-world
My first repository in GitHub.

Hi, guys.
I am Aero Wang, my chinese name is Wang,Teng-Hong.
I had take the C/C++ course at my colleage period.
and know about java/python/VBA a little.
I love python especially, because it is concise and beatiful, 
easy to understand what the code doing.
And there is tons of modules can be use on Internet.
but I find there is no particular language I master.
My middle goal is familir with JavaScript/Python.
and mix something cool first.
